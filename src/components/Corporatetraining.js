    <p align="justify" className='pt-3'>Testing accounts for almost 30 percent of the software development market. US spends an approximate $ 69.5 Bn on testing and the global outsourced testing market is estimated to be a $13 billion industry. With the boom of the third party software testing business, the need for quality and trained manpower has become a critical issue in the industry. Typically, the training focuses on process, tools, and certification in the testing space, and focused at creating entry level testers. Thus it presents a great opportunity for offering formal technical education in Software Testing, leading to an international certification.</p>
    <p align="justify"> Vivilex training’s are aimed at "learning by doing" and equip participants to go back and implement what they learn on-the-job.
